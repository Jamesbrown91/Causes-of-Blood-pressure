High cholestrol levels and late eating 
**Did you know that one in three American adults**
has high blood pressure? That number may surprise you. According to a report from the American Heart Association, high blood pressure contributes to nearly 1,000 deaths per day. For this reason, it’s important to have your blood pressure checked regularly — and get treatment if you have high blood pressure.

**Major factors**
The exact causes of high blood pressure are not known. However, some things may play a role in its development, including:

1. Smoking
2. Being overweight
3. Lack of physical activity
4. Too much salt in the dietDrinking too much alcohol (more than 1 to 2 drinks per day)
5. Older age
6. Family history of high blood pressure (heredity)
7. Race (African Americans have high blood pressure more often and more severely than White Americans)
8. Secondary causes
9. Adrenal gland tumors
1. Blood vessel problems present at birth, also called congenital heart defects
2. Cough and cold medicines, some pain relievers, birth control pills, and other prescription drugs
3. Illegal drugs, such as cocaine and amphetamines
4. Kidney disease
5. Obstructive sleep apnea
6. Thyroid problems
**Complications**
```
Heart attack or stroke. Hardening and thickening of the arteries due to high blood pressure or other factors can lead to a heart attack, stroke or other complications.
Aneurysm. Increased blood pressure can cause a blood vessel to weaken and bulge, forming an aneurysm. If an aneurysm ruptures, it can be life-threatening.
Heart failure. When you have high blood pressure, the heart has to work harder to pump blood. The strain causes the walls of the heart's pumping chamber to thicken. This condition is called left ventricular hypertrophy. Eventually, the heart can't pump enough blood to meet the body's needs, causing heart failure.
Kidney problems. High blood pressure can cause the blood vessels in the kidneys to become narrow or weak. This can lead to kidney damage.
Eye problems. Increased blood pressure can cause thickened, narrowed or torn blood vessels in the eyes. This can result in vision loss.
Metabolic syndrome. This syndrome is a group of disorders of the body's metabolism. It involves the irregular breakdown of sugar, also called glucose. The syndrome includes increased waist size, high triglycerides, decreased high-density lipoprotein (HDL or "good") cholesterol, high blood pressure and high blood sugar levels. These conditions make you more likely to develop diabetes, heart disease and stroke.
Changes with memory or understanding. Uncontrolled high blood pressure may affect the ability to think, remember and learn.
Dementia. Narrowed or blocked arteries can limit blood flow to the brain. This can cause a certain type of dementia called vascular dementia. A stroke that interrupts blood flow to the brain also can cause vascular dementia.

Summary and conclusion
As chronic kidney disease develops, many people will develop hypertension, they seem to go hand in hand. Conversely, people with hypertension develop chronic kidney disease as well," says Dr. Porter. "Control of high blood pressure is one of the most important things we can do when someone has chronic kidney disease."

And how you control it, mostly involves lifestyle changes.

"The thing about high blood pressure is it responds to many of the things we do in our lifestyle: regular exercise, avoiding processed foods, reduction of our sodium intake, more fruits and vegetables in our regular diet," says Dr. Porter. "Sometimes those lifestyle changes aren't enough. And these are the patients that need medications to help with blood pressure control. But we can make a huge impact with the decisions we make in our lifestyle to control blood pressure
